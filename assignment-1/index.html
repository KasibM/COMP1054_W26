                [Chorus]
            </b>
            <p>

                I hope they cancel me (Why? Why?)
                So I can go be with my family (Why? Why?)
                So I can quit wearin' this mask, dawg (Damn)
                Tell the people, "Kiss my ass, dawg" (Yeah, yeah)
            </p>

                [Verse 1]
            </b>
            <p>
                I hope they crucify me (Why?)
                I hope they put me down, I hope they euthanize me
                I hope I never, ever have to go on TV
                Mothafucka, Jimmy Kimmel does not wanna meet me
                I told my manager, "No more parties in Los Angeles"
                Last night, I fell deeper than BROCKHAMPTON down a rabbit hole
                Did so much blow, I won’t never find my appetite
                On my way home, I crashed into a satellite
                That's why my phone was obsolete for half the night
                That's why my dome is ringin’, baby
                As of right now, my job is to lie down
            </p>

            <p>
                Look, after tour, I broke up with my girlfriend (Why?)
                To fuck a bunch of bitches that I couldn't back then
                And yeah, that was cool, but now I'm empty as my room
                I guess my Insta keep me busy, I got plenty things to do
                But I told Reed, "No more of this LA shit"
                Last night keeps flashin' and I can't take it (One sec)
                Shut that phone up 'fore I break it (Hol’ up)
                Take me home before I say it
                I hope they banish me, I miss my family tree
                I was a family man, and now I’m just a man to see
                If you can't pay your rent or be responsible financially
                They need you, I hope I get Me Too’d

                    About Cancel Me
                </h3>
                <p> The song Cancel Me is about Dominic Fike expressing how overwhelming the stresses of his life and
                    recent fame have become. It describes wishing to be cancelled, so he could in some way reset this
                    period in his life and go back to a more simple time. While is it likely that Dominic Fike does not
                    wish to be implicated in some way that would lead him to be cancelled, the Fike uses the phenomenon
                    as an analogy for when life becomes too overwhelming, or you end up at a point in your life that
                    wasn't what you thought it would be, and you wish for a way to escape back to a better time.</p>

                        Dominic David Fike (born December 30, 1995) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, actor
                        and rapper. He first received recognition after releasing several popular songs to the website
                        SoundCloud. Following the release of his debut extended play, Don't Forget About Me, Demos
                        (2018), he signed to Columbia Records. Fike's song "3 Nights" reached the top ten in several
                        countries. He later collaborated with fellow American musicians Brockhampton and Halsey. His
                        debut album, What Could Possibly Go Wrong, was released in 2020. The album charted in the top 50
                        of multiple countries, including the United States and Australia. He recorded a cover of Paul
                        McCartney's song "The Kiss of Venus" for the album McCartney III Imagined (2021).
