                    <h3>
                        [Chorus]
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                    
                        I hope they cancel me (Why? Why?)
                        So I can go be with my family (Why? Why?)
                        So I can quit wearin' this mask, dawg (Damn)
                        Tell the people, "Kiss my ass, dawg" (Yeah, yeah)
                    </p>

                        [Verse 1]
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I hope they crucify me (Why?)
                        I hope they put me down, I hope they euthanize me
                        I hope I never, ever have to go on TV
                        Mothafucka, Jimmy Kimmel does not wanna meet me
                        I told my manager, "No more parties in Los Angeles"
                        Last night, I fell deeper than BROCKHAMPTON down a rabbit hole
                        Did so much blow, I won’t never find my appetite
                        On my way home, I crashed into a satellite
                        That's why my phone was obsolete for half the night
                        That's why my dome is ringin’, baby
                        As of right now, my job is to lie down
                    </p>

                        I hope they cancel me (Why? Why?)
                        So I can go be with my family (Why? Why?)
                        So I can quit wearin' this mask, dawg (Damn)

                    <p>
                        Look, after tour, I broke up with my girlfriend (Why?)
                        To fuck a bunch of bitches that I couldn't back then
                        And yeah, that was cool, but now I'm empty as my room
                        I guess my Insta keep me busy, I got plenty things to do
                        But I told Reed, "No more of this LA shit"
                        Last night keeps flashin' and I can't take it (One sec)
                        Shut that phone up 'fore I break it (Hol’ up)
                        Take me home before I say it
                        I hope they banish me, I miss my family tree
                        I was a family man, and now I’m just a man to see
                        If you can't pay your rent or be responsible financially
                        They need you, I hope I get Me Too’d
                    </p>
